# Getting Started with Local Web Application

This project features a React frontend and a flask backend, providing integrated support for sign language recognition and visual aid functionalities.

### Frontend (React)

In the `front` directory, you can run:

#### `npm install`

Installs the required dependencies for the React application.

#### `npm start`

Runs the React app in development mode.\

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
See the [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) section for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the React app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
